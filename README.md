## :clapper: Getting Started

I deployed my Next.js app using the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js. <br>
Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

You can also start this app on your local machine, following these steps:

### :pencil: Prerequisites

- clone this repository

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/egidiosalinaro/users-manager
  ```

- install all libraries and dependencies needed for this app

  ```sh
  npm install
  ```
### :gear: Installation

Once downloaded this repo, you are ready to go. <br> Now you can:

- configure your Supabase database as I did

  to match the routes called in this repo, your Supabase database should have a table called `users`

- connect your Supabase account

  create a `.env.local` file (you won't find mine because it is in the `.gitignore` list) containing all the environment variables required for Supabase to work, and fill them with your own keys

  ```sh
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
  ```

- start the app locally

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the app in action.

## :world_map: Roadmap

- [x] `.env.local` file containing keys
- [x] setting up Supabase
- [x] app and pages layout configuration
- [x] handling login and logout
- [x] creating hooks and actions
- [x] delete user logic
- [x] last modified property
- [x] report about customers gender
